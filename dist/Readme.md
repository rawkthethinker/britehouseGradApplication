This is a template of all the components that show up on the Graduate Program Application

I Provided all the components of the needed in the class property of the element, hopefully it is
easy enough to just take the classes of the elements and just paste them on the current Graduate Program Site

The Header Skeleton is the main navigation bar

And the background for now is white until we are provided with a background image
